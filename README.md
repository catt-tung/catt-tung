## About Me
### Hi there! Iâ€™m Catt.

Iâ€™m an engineer/developer/tech enthusiast.

Prior to engineering, I worked as a Business Development Manager in London (UK) on [balena.ioâ€™s](balena.io) [EtcherPro](https://www.balena.io/etcher-pro/) team. Inspired by the capabilities of shipping Docker containers on Raspberry Pi's, I created the conception of the [Inkyshot](https://github.com/balenalabs/inkyshot) project while working as a hardware/supply chain manager and logistics/operations specialist for the company.

Later on, I started my hands on coding experience with General Assembly's Software Engineering Intensive, and have been working in technical roles ever since. In terms of programming primarily worked in Python for work, and JavaScript for personal projects. In other aspects of work, I've worked with Linux, Docker, and now going on into Kubernetes.

Apart from coding, I've lived in many countries and cities and speak multiple languages - English  ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§&ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ , Mandarin ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼, ItalianðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹&ðŸ¤Œ, SpanishðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, and some BulgarianðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬ and TaiwaneseðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼. I've had so many incredible experiences in so many different cultures and world cities, and feel like it's all just getting started.

My dev portfolio/CV can be found at [Catt Codes](https://cattcodes.com/). The project links unfortunately aren't live deployed anymore since Heroku changed their free tier, but I like how it looks on the website. Maybe I can think about redeploying them in another way when I get the chance, but I'm always really busy with either projects, studying, or gathering more industry knowledge that usually that takes priority at the moment.

I also sometimes write about my learning journey on [DevDojo](https://cattkaizen.devdojo.com/) if you'd like to connect - it's mostly to keep myself accountable, but I'm thinking about getting more into documenting more of my experiences with all the new things I'm studying and learning.
