## About Me
### Hi there! I’m Catt.

I’m a full stack software engineer with a keen eye for styling and strong architectural sensibility. I’m currently living in Boston, Massachusetts.

Prior to software engineering, I was a Business Development Manager in London (in the UK, not Ohio) at [balena.io’s](balena.io) [EtcherPro](https://www.balena.io/etcher/pro/) team. I created the conception of the [Inkyshot](https://github.com/balenalabs/inkyshot) project as well. 

Driven by a desire to have a more involved contribution to the industry in which I was raised, I sought to develop more technical skills so I could have a larger impact on the product iteration aspect in software companies and developer tools.

I love building projects with a personal connection and backstory to bring my unique not-yet-tapped background into the industry. I intend to build impactful apps with high standards for long-lasting code that adapt and evolve with the times.
